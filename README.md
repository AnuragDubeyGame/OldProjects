# Dijkstra Algorithm Playground in Unity

Welcome to the Dijkstra Algorithm Playground in Unity! This project is a work in progress designed to help you experiment with Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. Please note that it is currently under development and not yet a fully-fledged visualization tool. It is intended for educational purposes and experimentation. As a work in progress, it may not be perfect, lacks documentation, and might have limited controls.

## Project Overview

This Unity project allows you to create nodes, establish edges between them, and then run the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to a destination node. It provides a visual representation of the algorithm in action, making it a great tool for learning and understanding Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Download the Project**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open with Unity**: Open Unity and click on "Open Project." Select the folder where you downloaded the project.

3. **Select Scene**: In the Unity project, navigate to the "Scenes" folder and open the "Main" scene.

4. **Play**: Hit the play button in the Unity editor, and the project should run in the Unity Play Mode.

## Controls

- **Right Click**: Add Nodes to the scene. This will create a node at the clicked location.

- **Click and Drag**: Connect nodes by clicking and dragging from one node to another. This action adds an edge between nodes, and you can specify the weight in a Weight Input Field that appears during the connection.

- **Press Space**: Run the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path from the blue (source) node to the yellow (destination) node. The algorithm's progress will be visually displayed in the scene.

- **Blue Node**: Represents the source node from which the algorithm will find the shortest path.

- **Yellow Node**: Represents the destination node to which the algorithm will find the shortest path.

## Note

Please keep in mind that this project is a testing ground for visualizing Dijkstra's algorithm. While it can help you learn and experiment with the algorithm, it is not a polished, production-ready application. There are no detailed documentation and may be limited controls. Feel free to modify and improve the project as needed for your educational purposes.

If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to create an issue in this repository. Happy learning and exploring Dijkstra's algorithm in Unity!
