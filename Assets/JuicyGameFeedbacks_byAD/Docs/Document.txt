Getting Started:


Install the "JuicyGameFeedbacks_byAD" asset from the Unity Asset Store.
Creating Player Jump Feedback:

Open your player controller script.
Add a serialized Feedback_Base variable to represent the player jump feedback:

```
[SerializeField] private Feedback_Base PlayerJumpFeedback;
```

In your player controller's jump function, call the Play() method on the PlayerJumpFeedback variable:

```
private void Jump()
{
    PlayerJumpFeedback.Play();
}
```

Customizing Feedback:
You can customize the feedbacks in the inspector by selecting the Feedback_Base variable in the inspector and adjusting the parameters to your desired values.

That's it! You have successfully added a player jump feedback to your game with just two lines of code. Enjoy using the JuicyGameFeedbacks_byAD asset to bring life to your game.
